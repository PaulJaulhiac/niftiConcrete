# README: Data Conversion Tools

## Overview
This suite of scripts facilitates the conversion between several file formats commonly used in imaging and visualization tasks. 
Supported conversions include:

    .key to .vtk for 3D visualization of features extracted from nifti files, via 3D-SIFT program.
    A program adapted from Laurent Chauvin and Matthew Toews work on feature extraction

    .tiff to .jpg for standard image format conversion.
    .jpg to .nifti for medical imaging analysis.
    .tiff to .nifti for use in medical imaging environments.

## Requirements

    Python: Python 3.6 or newer.
    Libraries:
        pandas and vtk for .key to .vtk.
        Pillow for image operations.
        nibabel for handling .nifti files.
        Install required libraries using:

        bash cmd:

        pip install pandas vtk Pillow nibabel

## Scripts

    convertKey2Vtk.py: Converts spatial data from .key files into .vtk format.
    convertTiff2Jpg.sh: Converts .tiff images to .jpg format.
    convertJpg2Nifti.py: Converts .jpg images to .nifti format.
    convertTiff2Nifti.py: Converts .tiff images to .nifti format.

## Usage

    Configuration: Edit each script to specify the input and output file paths.
    Execution:
        Run the desired script from the command line:

        bash cmd:

        python [script_name]

## Examples

Convert .key to .vtk:

    # Input: key file containing XYZ and scale, extracted from NIfTI file using 3D-SIFT program. (Cf. 3DSIFT-Rank-Paul-Jaulhiac_CompileFix) 
    # Output: VTK file with points and scale as scalars.

Convert .jpg to .nifti:

    # Input: JPEG image file.
    # Output: NIfTI file suitable for medical imaging software.

Convert .tiff to .jpg:

    # Input: TIFF image file.
    # Output: JPEG image file.

Convert .tiff to .nifti:

    # Input: TIFF image file.
    # Output: NIfTI file for medical imaging purposes.

## Troubleshooting

    Incorrect File Paths: Ensure file paths in the script are correctly configured for your environment.
    Library Issues: Confirm that all dependencies are installed. Reinstall if there are errors.
    Data Format Errors: Make sure input files adhere to expected formats. Modify scripts to accommodate variations if necessary.

## Additional Notes

    Always test scripts with a small set of files before processing large datasets to ensure configurations are correct.
    Review output files to confirm successful conversions, especially when integrating into new workflows.
